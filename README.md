To get started.

Assumes you have pipenv installed.

Run `pipenv install` to install all dependencies and create a virtual environment for your project.

Copy `.env.defaults` to `.env` and replace `MEATER_EMAIL` and `MEATER_PASSWORD` with your Meater account credentials.

Run `pipenv run getkey` to get your API key, add that to your `.env` file as `MEATER_KEY`.
